# Production Blockchain Setup

## Your Wallet Configuration
- **Address**: `0xC441CE69E4aF8286D361f378B0A06362ecF9528a`
- **Private Key**: Stored securely in database
- **Current Balance**: 1000 ETH (database value for testing)

## To Use Real Ethereum:

### 1. Get Ethereum RPC Access
```bash
# Sign up for Infura (infura.io) or Alchemy (alchemy.com)
# Get your API key and update environment variables:
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Fund Your Wallet
- Send real ETH to: `0xC441CE69E4aF8286D361f378B0A06362ecF9528a`
- Use an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, or a hardware wallet
- Start with small amounts for testing

### 3. Security Considerations
- Private keys are stored in database - consider using hardware wallets for production
- Implement multi-signature wallets for large amounts
- Use testnet (Sepolia) for development and testing

### 4. Real Transaction Features
- ✅ Real wallet generation with ethers.js
- ✅ Blockchain balance fetching
- ✅ Transaction broadcasting
- ✅ Gas estimation and pricing
- ✅ Transaction status monitoring

### 5. Current Limitations
- Need RPC provider API key for mainnet access
- Recommend using testnet first to verify functionality
- Consider implementing additional security layers

## Testing on Testnet
Use Sepolia testnet for safe testing:
1. Get test ETH from Sepolia faucet
2. Test all functions without real money risk
3. Verify everything works before mainnet use
